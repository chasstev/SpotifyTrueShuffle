## About
Made with: Python, Flask, Oauth2, Tkinter, pillow, ttkthemes, Pdoc
- A program that truly shuffles your Spotify playlist randomly unlike the default Spotify shuffle function.
- Customizable song shuffle functionality, allowing users to select how many songs to shuffle.
- Integrated with the Spotify API using a Flask server to enable authentication, get your playlists, shuffle your playlists, and add shuffled songs to your queue.
- Created an authentication system that securely connects to Spotify, using an Oauth2 token-based flow.
- Leveraged multithreading to handle API requests and improve application responsiveness.
- Used the Pillow library to process and resize playlist images dynamically.
- Enhanced user experience with custom themes and responsive GUI design.
